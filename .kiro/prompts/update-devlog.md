# Update DevLog - Development Progress Tracker

Update the DEVLOG.md with recent development activities, decisions, and progress. This prompt helps maintain a comprehensive development timeline for the hackathon submission.

## DevLog Structure

The DEVLOG follows this format:
- **Timeline**: Chronological development entries
- **Technical Decisions**: Architecture choices and rationale
- **Kiro CLI Usage**: Prompt usage statistics and productivity impact
- **Challenges & Solutions**: Problems encountered and how they were solved
- **Performance Metrics**: Actual system performance and improvements
- **Time Tracking**: Hours spent on different development categories

## Update Types

### 1. Daily Development Entry
**Format:**
```markdown
### Day X (Date) - Feature/Focus [Xh]
- **Morning/Afternoon**: What was accomplished
- **Key Implementation**: Major features or components built
- **Technical Decision**: Important choices made and why
- **Challenge**: Problems encountered and solutions
- **Kiro CLI Usage**: Which prompts were used and how they helped
```

### 2. Technical Decision Documentation
**Format:**
```markdown
#### Technology Choice
**Decision**: What was chosen
**Rationale**: Why this choice was made
**Alternatives Considered**: Other options evaluated
**Impact**: How this affects the project
```

### 3. Kiro CLI Usage Tracking
**Format:**
```markdown
**Kiro CLI Usage**: @prompt-name helped with [specific task]
**Time Saved**: Estimated productivity improvement
**Innovation**: Creative use of Kiro CLI features
```

### 4. Performance Metrics Update
**Format:**
```markdown
**Performance Results:**
- Metric: Target vs Achieved
- Improvement: X% better than previous
- Impact: User experience or cost benefit
```

## Current DevLog Status

Your DEVLOG.md already contains:
- ✅ Comprehensive 60-hour development timeline
- ✅ Detailed Kiro CLI usage statistics (73 prompts used)
- ✅ Technical architecture decisions and rationale
- ✅ Performance metrics and optimization results
- ✅ Time breakdown by development category
- ✅ Innovation highlights and lessons learned

## Update Instructions

To update the DEVLOG, provide:

1. **What happened**: Recent development activities or milestones
2. **When**: Date/time period for the activities
3. **Technical details**: Any architecture decisions or implementations
4. **Kiro CLI usage**: Which prompts were used and their impact
5. **Metrics**: Any performance improvements or measurements
6. **Time spent**: Hours invested in different activities

## Example Updates

### Recent Development Session
```markdown
### Day 19 (Jan 7) - Hackathon Preparation [3h]
- **14:00-17:00**: Kiro CLI configuration and hackathon documentation
- **Key Implementation**: Created 6 custom Kiro prompts and steering documents
- **Technical Decision**: Structured .kiro/ directory for optimal workflow
- **Innovation**: @code-review-hackathon prompt for submission evaluation
- **Kiro CLI Usage**: @prime, @plan-feature, @execute workflow established
- **Time Saved**: 2+ hours through systematic prompt-driven development
```

### Performance Improvement
```markdown
**Performance Optimization Results:**
- Search Response Time: 2.1s → 1.8s (14% improvement)
- Cache Hit Rate: 70% → 75% (5% improvement)
- Bundle Size: 520KB → 485KB (7% reduction)
- **Impact**: Better user experience and reduced infrastructure costs
```

### Technical Decision
```markdown
#### Multi-Layer Caching Architecture
**Decision**: Implemented Memory → Redis → Database caching strategy
**Rationale**: Optimize performance while minimizing API costs
**Alternatives Considered**: Single-layer Redis, database-only caching
**Results**: 60% cost reduction, 40% performance improvement
**Kiro CLI Usage**: @system-review identified optimization opportunities
```

## Hackathon-Specific Tracking

For hackathon submission, emphasize:

### Kiro CLI Integration
- **Prompt Usage**: Track each @prompt usage and its benefit
- **Workflow Innovation**: Document how Kiro CLI changed your development process
- **Time Savings**: Quantify productivity improvements
- **Custom Prompts**: Document creation and refinement of project-specific prompts

### Development Productivity
- **Before/After**: Compare development speed with and without Kiro CLI
- **Context Management**: How steering documents improved consistency
- **Quality Assurance**: How @code-review prevented issues
- **Planning Efficiency**: How @plan-feature reduced scope creep

### Innovation Documentation
- **Technical Innovations**: Unique solutions and implementations
- **Architecture Decisions**: Novel approaches to common problems
- **Performance Optimizations**: Creative solutions for speed/cost
- **User Experience**: Innovative UX patterns or interactions

## Update Request
